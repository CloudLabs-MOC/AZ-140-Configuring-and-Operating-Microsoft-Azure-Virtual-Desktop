## Instructions

### Exercise 0: Prerequisite - Setup Azure AD Connect
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual machines** and, from the **Virtual machines** blade, select **az140-dc-vm11**.
2. On the **az140-dc-vm11** blade, select **Connect**, in the drop-down menu, select **Bastion**.
3. On the **Bastion** tab of the **az140-dc-vm11**, when prompted, provide the following credentials and select **Connect**:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User Name|**Student**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

   > **Note**: On clicking **Connect**, if you encounter an error **A popup blocker is preventing new window from opening. Please allow popups and retry**, then select the popup blocker icon at the top, select **Always allow pop-ups and redirects from https://portal.azure.com** and click on **Done**, and try connecting to the VM again.
  
   > **Note**: If you are prompted **See text and images copied to the clipboard**, select **Allow**. 

4. Once logged in, a logon task will start executing. When prompted **Do you want PowerShell to install and import the Nuget provider now?** enter **Y** and hit enter.
   > **Note**: Wait for the logon task to complete and present you with **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard. This should take about 10 minutes. If the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard is not presented to you after the logon task completes, then launch it manually by double clicking the **Azure AD Connect** icon on the desktop.

5. On the **Welcome to Azure AD Connect** page of the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard, select the checkbox **I agree to the license terms and privacy notice** and select **Continue**.
6. On the **Express Settings** page of the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard, select the **Customize** option.
