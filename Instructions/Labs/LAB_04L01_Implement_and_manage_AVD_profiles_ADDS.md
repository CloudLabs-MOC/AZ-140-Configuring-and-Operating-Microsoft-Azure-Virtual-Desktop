## Lab scenario

You need to implement Azure Virtual Desktop profile management in an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment.

## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Implement FSLogix based profiles for Azure Virtual Desktop

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Exercise 1: Prerequisite - Setup Azure AD Connect
1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal]( ), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.
2. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual machines** and, from the **Virtual machines** blade, select **az140-dc-vm11**.
3. On the **az140-dc-vm11** blade, select **Connect**, in the drop-down menu, select **Bastion**.
4. On the **Bastion** tab of the **az140-dc-vm11**, when prompted, provide the following credentials and select **Connect**:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User Name|**Student**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

   > **Note**: On clicking **Connect**, if you encounter an error **A popup blocker is preventing new window from opening. Please allow popups and retry**, then select the popup blocker icon at the top, select **Always allow pop-ups and redirects from https://portal.azure.com** and click on **Done**, and try connecting to the VM again.
  
   > **Note**: If you are prompted **See text and images copied to the clipboard**, select **Allow**. 

5. Once logged in, a logon task will start executing. When prompted **Do you want PowerShell to install and import the Nuget provider now?** enter **Y** and hit enter.
   > **Note**: Wait for the logon task to complete and present you with **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard. This should take about 10 minutes. If the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard is not presented to you after the logon task completes, then launch it manually by double clicking the **Azure AD Connect** icon on the desktop.


6. On the **Welcome to Azure AD Connect** page of the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard, select the checkbox **I agree to the license terms and privacy notice** and select **Continue**.
7. On the **Express Settings** page of the **Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect** wizard, select the **Customize** option.
8. On the **Install required components** page, leave all optional configuration options deselected and select **Install**.
9. On the **User sign-in** page, ensure that only the **Password Hash Synchronization** is enabled and select **Next**.
10. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, authenticate by using the credentials of the **aadsyncuser** user account you created in the previous exercise and select **Next**. 

    > **Note**: Provide the userPrincipalName attribute of the **aadsyncuser** account available in the **LabValues** text file present on desktop and specify the password **Pa55w.rd1234**.

11. On the **Connect your directories** page, select the **Add Directory** button to the right of the **adatum.com** forest entry.
